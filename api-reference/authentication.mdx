    Navigate to **Settings → API Keys**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Key">
    Click **Create API Key**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Key">

</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.usebuddy.io/v1/customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Key Management

### Viewing Keys

Go to **Settings → API Keys** to see all your API keys:
- Key name
- Created date
- Last used date
- Status (active/revoked)

### Rolling Keys

To rotate a key without downtime:

1. Create a new key
2. Update your integrations to use the new key
3. Verify everything works
4. Revoke the old key

### Revoking Keys

To revoke a key:

1. Go to **Settings → API Keys**
2. Find the key to revoke
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Confirm revocation

Revoked keys immediately stop working.
