## Managing Integrations

All integrations are managed from **Settings → Integrations**.

### Connecting

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations**
2. Click **Connect** next to the integration
3. Authorize access in the external service
4. Initial sync begins automatically

### Sync Status

Each integration shows:
- **Connected**: Integration is active and syncing
- **Last Synced**: When data was last synchronized
- **Sync Now**: Button to manually trigger sync

### Disconnecting

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations**
2. Click **Disconnect** next to the integration
3. Confirm disconnection

<Note>
Disconnecting an integration keeps your existing data in Buddy. It only stops future synchronization.
</Note>

## How Sync Works

### Sync Frequency

| Integration | Automatic Sync | Manual Sync |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Shopify | Every few minutes | Click "Sync" |
| QuickBooks | Every few minutes | Click "Sync" |
| Slack | Real-time | N/A |
| Email | Real-time | N/A |

### Sync Direction

| Integration | From External | To External |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Shopify | Products, customers, orders | Product updates, customer updates |
| QuickBooks | Customers, invoices, payments | New invoices |
| Slack | — | Notifications |
| Email | Incoming POs | — |

## Data Conflicts

When data differs between systems:

1. Buddy creates a review in [Data Quality](/features/data-reviews)
2. You choose which version to keep
3. Changes sync back to the external system

Buddy never overwrites data without your approval.

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="Integration shows disconnected">

  <Accordion title="Data not syncing">
    1. Check the integration is connected (green status)
    2. Click **Sync** to manually trigger
    3. Check for errors in the sync log
    4. Verify the data exists in the source system
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate records appearing">
    This may happen during initial sync. Review items in [Data Quality](/features/data-reviews) to merge duplicates.
