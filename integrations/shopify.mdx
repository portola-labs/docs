</Note>

### Channel Source

## Sync Frequency

- **Products**: Every few minutes
- **Customers**: Every few minutes
- **Orders**: Near real-time via webhooks

Click **Sync** on the integration page to manually trigger a sync.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Products not appearing">
    1. Check the product is published in Shopify
    2. Click **Sync** to manually refresh
    3. Wait a few minutes for sync to complete
    4. Check if the product was imported with a different name
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prices not updating">
    Price sync to Shopify only includes changes made in Buddy. Changes made directly in Shopify sync to Buddy, not the reverse.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate products">
    If you imported products before connecting Shopify, duplicates may occur. Use [Data Quality](/features/data-reviews) to merge records.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing variants">
    Check that the variant is active in Shopify. Draft or archived variants may not sync.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection lost">
    Go to **Settings → Integrations** and click **Reconnect** to re-authorize.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
