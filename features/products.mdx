The Products section is where you manage your product catalog, including variants, SKUs, and pricing.

## Understanding Products and Variants

Buddy uses a two-level product structure:

- **Product**: The main item (e.g., "Classic T-Shirt")
- **Variant**: Specific versions with their own SKU and price (e.g., "Classic T-Shirt - Blue, Large")

Each variant is what actually gets ordered and has its own:
- SKU
- UPC/Barcode
- Price
- Unit level (Each, Pack, Case, Pallet)

## Viewing Products

Navigate to **Products** in the sidebar. You can:
- **Search**: By name, SKU, or UPC
- **Filter**: By status, category, or integration
- **Expand**: Click the arrow to see variants

</Steps>

## Adding Variants

1. Open a product's details (click the expand arrow)
2. Click **Add Variant**
3. Enter variant-specific information:
   - SKU (required)
   - Price

## Unit Levels

Products can be sold at different unit levels:

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Each** | Individual units | 1 bottle |
| **Pack** | Small groupings | 6-pack |
| **Case** | Standard shipping cartons | 24 units |
| **Pallet** | Bulk quantities | 100 cases |

Each unit level can have its own price, allowing quantity-based pricing.

## Editing Prices

Two ways to edit product prices:

1. **Inline editing**: Click directly on the price in the table
2. **Full edit**: Click the **...** menu → **Edit** for all fields

## Product Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Product display name |
| **Description** | Product description |
| **SKU** | Stock keeping unit (per variant) |
| **UPC** | Universal product code (barcode) |
| **Price** | Base price (before tier discounts) |
| **Unit Level** | Each, Pack, Case, or Pallet |
| **Status** | Active, Discontinued, Seasonal, Draft |
| **Category** | Product category for organization |

## Integration Sync

Products from connected integrations show source badges:

- **S** (Shopify): Includes Shopify product ID and variant ID
- **QB** (QuickBooks): Includes QuickBooks Item ID
- **C** (Cin7): Includes Cin7 product ID

Synced products update automatically when changed in either system.

## Bulk Actions

Select multiple products to:
- **Export**: Download as CSV
- **Update Status**: Change status for all selected
- **Delete**: Remove products (if no order history)

## Importing Products

See [Import & Export](/features/import-export) for details on bulk importing products from CSV or Excel files.

## Tips for Better Matching

To improve automatic matching when processing POs:

1. **Add alternative SKUs**: Include customer-specific SKUs as aliases
2. **Include UPC codes**: Barcodes help with matching
3. **Use consistent naming**: Keep product names standardized
4. **Add common misspellings**: Include variations customers might use
