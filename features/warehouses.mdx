If you fulfill orders from multiple locations, warehouse management helps you track which customers and products are served by which location.

## Why Use Warehouses?

Warehouses (stock locations) help you:
- **Route orders correctly**: Ensure orders ship from the right facility
- **Assign customer territories**: Default customers to their nearest warehouse
- **Manage product availability**: Track which products are stocked where
- **Optimize fulfillment**: Reduce shipping costs and times

## Setting Up Warehouses

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Warehouse Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings → Warehouses**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Warehouse">
    Click **Add Warehouse**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Details">
    Fill in warehouse name and address
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to create the warehouse
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Warehouse Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name (e.g., "East Coast DC") |
| **Address** | Physical warehouse address |
| **Contact** | Warehouse manager or contact |
| **Phone** | Contact phone number |
| **Notes** | Internal notes |
| **Default** | Set as default for new customers |

## Assigning Customers to Warehouses

Each customer can have a default warehouse:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Customer Profile">
    Navigate to the customer's profile
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Warehouse Setting">
    Locate the **Default Warehouse** field
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Warehouse">
    Choose which warehouse typically fulfills this customer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to apply
  </Step>
</Steps>

When creating orders for this customer, the selected warehouse is used by default.

## Product Warehouse Requirements

Some products may need to ship from specific locations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Product Details">
    Navigate to the product's details
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Required Warehouse">
    Locate the **Required Warehouse** field
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Warehouse">
    Choose the warehouse that stocks this product
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to apply
  </Step>
</Steps>

Orders containing this product will route to the specified warehouse.

## How Routing Works

When creating an order, Buddy determines the fulfillment location:

1. **Product requirement**: If any product requires a specific warehouse, use that
2. **Customer default**: Otherwise, use the customer's default warehouse
3. **Organization default**: If neither is set, use the organization's default
4. **Manual selection**: You can always override when creating the order

<Note>
If products in an order require different warehouses, you may need to split the order or handle it manually.
</Note>

## Multi-Warehouse Orders

For orders that span multiple warehouses:

- **Split orders**: Create separate orders for each warehouse
- **Manual override**: Select a primary warehouse and add notes
- **Partial fulfillment**: Ship what's available and backorder the rest

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if a customer is near multiple warehouses?">
    Set their default to the most commonly used warehouse. You can override on individual orders when needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I track inventory by warehouse?">
    If connected to an inventory system (Cin7, Shopify with locations), stock levels sync per location. Otherwise, warehouse management in Buddy focuses on order routing rather than inventory tracking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle drop shipping?">
    Create a "warehouse" for each drop ship vendor. Assign products to their respective vendor locations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I only have one location?">
    You don't need to set up warehouse management. It's optional for businesses with multiple fulfillment locations.
