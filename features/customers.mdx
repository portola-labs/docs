### Location Fields

Each location can have:
- **Name**: Descriptive name for the location
- **Address**: Full shipping address
- **Contact**: Person to contact for deliveries
- **Phone**: Direct phone number
- **Notes**: Special delivery instructions

## How Buddy Helps You

### Automatic Duplicate Detection

When you add a new customer or import data, Buddy checks for potential duplicates by comparing:
- Company name (including common variations)
- Email address
- Phone number
- Billing address

**What you'll see:**
- **Duplicate found**: Buddy warns you and suggests the existing customer
- **Possible duplicate**: You'll be asked to confirm if it's the same customer
- **No match**: Customer is created normally

This prevents accidentally creating duplicate accounts for the same customer.

### Price Tier Assignment

When a customer is assigned a pricing tier, all their orders automatically use that tier's pricing:

1. You assign a customer to "Wholesale" tier
2. When creating orders for this customer, all products show wholesale prices
3. No manual price adjustments needed

**What you'll see:**
- Product prices automatically adjust based on the customer's tier
- Order totals reflect the correct tier discounts
- You can still override individual prices if needed

### Stock Location Assignment

If you have multiple warehouses, you can assign customers to a default location:

1. You set "East Coast DC" as the customer's default warehouse
2. When creating orders, that warehouse is automatically selected
3. Orders route to the correct fulfillment location

This saves time and ensures orders ship from the right place.

## Integration Sync

Customers from connected integrations show badges indicating their source:

- **S** (Shopify): Synced from Shopify
- **QB** (QuickBooks): Synced from QuickBooks
- **F** (Faire): Synced from Faire

Changes to these customers sync bidirectionally—updates in Buddy appear in the source system.

## Bulk Actions

Select multiple customers to:
- **Export**: Download as CSV
- **Assign Tier**: Change pricing tier for all selected
- **Change Status**: Mark active or inactive

## Deleting Customers

<Warning>
Customers with existing orders cannot be deleted. This preserves order history.
</Warning>

To remove a customer from active use, change their status to **Inactive** instead.

## Importing Customers

See [Import & Export](/features/import-export) for details on bulk importing customers from CSV or Excel files.
