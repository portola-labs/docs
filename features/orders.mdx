## How Buddy Matches For You

When you forward a purchase order or create an order, Buddy automatically does the heavy lifting:

### Customer Matching

Buddy looks at the PO and tries to find the right customer in your system by comparing:
- Company name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Billing address

**What you'll see:**
- **Confident match**: The customer is selected automatically
- **Possible match**: Buddy suggests a customer but asks you to confirm
- **No match**: You'll be asked to select or create the customer

### Product Matching

For each line item on the PO, Buddy finds the matching product by comparing:
- SKU or item number
- Product name
- Description

**What you'll see:**
- **Matched**: Product found and added to the order
- **Possible match**: Buddy suggests a product for you to confirm
- **Unmatched**: The item needs manual selection

### Automatic Assignments

Once a customer is matched, Buddy automatically applies:

| Setting | How It's Applied |
|---------|------------------|
| **Price Tier** | Customer's assigned tier determines all product pricing |
| **Stock Location** | Customer's default warehouse is selected for fulfillment |
| **Shipping Address** | Customer's saved locations are available to select |
| **Payment Terms** | Customer's terms are applied to the order |

<Tip>
The better your customer and product data, the more accurate automatic matching becomes. Keep SKUs consistent and customer information up to date.
</Tip>

### When Review Is Needed

Items that can't be matched confidently appear in [Data Reviews](/features/data-reviews). You'll see reviews when:
- A customer name is similar but not exact
- A product SKU doesn't exist in your catalog
- Pricing seems unusual compared to history
- Required information is missing

## Editing Orders

Click any order to edit:
- Add or remove products
- Change quantities
- Update shipping location
- Modify notes

Changes save automatically.

<Warning>
Orders with invoices may have limited editing to maintain accounting accuracy.
</Warning>

## Creating Invoices

To create a QuickBooks invoice from an order:

1. Select one or more orders
2. Click **Create Invoice** in the actions
3. The invoice is created in both Buddy and QuickBooks

## Bulk Actions

Select multiple orders to:
- **Update Status**: Change status for all selected
- **Create Invoices**: Generate invoices for all selected
- **Export**: Download as CSV

## Filtering Orders

Use filters to find specific orders:
- **Status**: Filter by order status
- **Customer**: Filter by customer account
- **Date Range**: Filter by order date
- **Channel**: Filter by order source (manual, email, Shopify, etc.)

## Order History

Every order maintains a complete history:
- Status changes with timestamps
- Who made each change
- Original vs. modified values

View history in the order's Activity tab.
