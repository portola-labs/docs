## What to Expect

When processing orders, Buddy automatically:

- **Matches customers**: Identifies the customer from the PO
- **Matches products**: Finds products by SKU, name, or description
- **Applies pricing**: Uses the customer's tier pricing
- **Flags issues**: Creates reviews for items needing attention

Items that can't be matched confidently appear in [Data Reviews](/features/data-reviews).

## Editing Orders

Click any order to edit:
- Add or remove products
- Change quantities

Changes save automatically.

<Warning>
Orders with invoices may have limited editing to maintain accounting accuracy.
