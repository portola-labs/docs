Data Reviews are items that Buddy has flagged for your attention. They help ensure data quality and accuracy across your customers, products, and orders.

## Where to Find Reviews

Navigate to **Data Quality** in the sidebar to see all pending reviews. You can filter by:
- **Entity type**: Customers, Products, Orders, Line Items
- **Review type**: Duplicates, matches, data quality issues
- **Priority**: Urgent, High, Normal, Low
- **Status**: Pending, In Progress, Approved, Rejected

## Review Types

### Matching Reviews

These reviews relate to how Buddy matches incoming data to your existing records.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match" icon="check">
    **What it means**: Buddy found a confident match between incoming data and an existing record.

    **When it appears**: During PO processing or data imports when a customer or product is identified with high confidence.

    **What to do**: Review and approve if correct, or select a different match if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Low Confidence Match" icon="question">
    **What it means**: Buddy found a potential match but isn't certain it's correct.

    **When it appears**: When incoming data partially matches existing records (e.g., similar but not identical names).

    **What to do**: Review both records carefully. Approve if they're the same, or dismiss and select the correct match.

    **Example**: An incoming PO has "Acme Corp" but your database has "Acme Corporation" and "Acme Co LLC"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="New Unmatched" icon="plus">
    **What it means**: Buddy couldn't find any matching record in your database.

    **When it appears**: When a customer or product in an incoming order doesn't match anything in your system.

    **What to do**:
    - Search for the record manually (it may exist under a different name)
    - Create a new record if it's genuinely new
    - Link to an existing record if you find it
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate" icon="copy">
    **What it means**: Buddy detected two records that appear to be the same entity.

    **When it appears**: During imports, integration syncs, or periodic data quality scans.

    **What to do**: Compare both records side by side. Choose to merge them (combining into one) or dismiss if they're legitimately different.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Line Item Reviews

These reviews are specific to order line items (products in an order).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Line Item Match" icon="link">
    **What it means**: A product in an incoming PO was matched to a product in your catalog.

    **When it appears**: During email PO processing when products are identified.

    **What to do**: Verify the match is correct and approve, or select a different product.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Line Item Unmatched" icon="unlink">
    **What it means**: A product in an incoming PO couldn't be matched to your catalog.

    **When it appears**: When the PO contains a product code or description that doesn't match any of your products.

    **What to do**:
    - Search your catalog to find the correct product
    - Create a new product if it's not in your system
    - Update your product with additional SKUs or aliases for future matching
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Data Quality Reviews

These reviews flag potential issues with your data.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing Field" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **What it means**: A record is missing important information.

    **When it appears**: When required fields are empty (e.g., customer missing billing email).

    **What to do**: Open the record and fill in the missing information.

    **Common missing fields**:
    - Customer billing email (needed for invoices)
    - Product SKU (needed for order processing)
    - Shipping address (needed for fulfillment)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Conflict" icon="code-branch">
    **What it means**: Data differs between Buddy and a connected system.

    **When it appears**: When synced data doesn't match (e.g., different prices in Shopify vs Buddy).

    **What to do**: Review both versions and choose which to keep, or update both systems to match.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Price Anomaly" icon="chart-line">
    **What it means**: An unusual price was detected that may be an error.

    **When it appears**: When a price is significantly different from historical prices or appears to be a typo.

    **What to do**: Verify the price is correct. If it's an error, correct it. If it's intentional (e.g., a sale), dismiss the review.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Review Priority Levels

Reviews are assigned priority levels to help you focus on what's most important:

| Priority | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Urgent** | Requires immediate attention | Order blocked from processing |
| **High** | Should be resolved soon | Customer missing from order |
| **Normal** | Standard review item | Potential duplicate detected |
| **Low** | Can be addressed when convenient | Minor data quality suggestion |

## Resolving Reviews

### Approve
Confirms the suggested action (e.g., the match is correct). The review is marked complete.

### Reject
Indicates the suggestion is incorrect. You'll typically need to provide the correct information.

### Merge
For duplicate reviews, combines two records into one. You choose which data to keep for each field.

### Link
Connects an unmatched item to an existing record you've identified.

### Skip
Temporarily sets aside a review to address later. Use this when you need more information.

### Dismiss
Closes the review without action because it's not actually an issue (e.g., two customers with the same name that are different companies).

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Review Regularly" icon="calendar">
    Check Data Quality daily to prevent backlogs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prioritize Urgent Items" icon="fire">
    Urgent reviews may block order processing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Filters" icon="filter">
    Focus on one review type at a time for efficiency
  </Card>
  <Card title="Train Your Team" icon="users">
    Ensure everyone knows how to handle reviews

## Reducing Future Reviews

To minimize the number of reviews:

1. **Maintain clean data**: Keep customer names and product SKUs consistent
2. **Add aliases**: Add alternative SKUs and names to products for better matching
3. **Update records promptly**: When you learn a customer's official name, update it
4. **Use integrations**: Connected systems reduce manual data entry errors

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why am I seeing so many reviews?">
    Reviews typically increase after:
    - Initial data import (duplicates detected)
    - Connecting a new integration (data conflicts)
    - Processing POs from new customers

    The number decreases as you resolve items and Buddy learns your preferences.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I bulk resolve reviews?">
    Yes, select multiple reviews using checkboxes and use bulk actions to approve, skip, or dismiss them together.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I ignore reviews?">
    Pending reviews don't block most operations, but:
    - Urgent reviews may prevent order processing
    - Unresolved duplicates can cause confusion
    - Missing data may cause invoice or fulfillment issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Buddy learn from my decisions?">
    When you approve matches or merge duplicates, Buddy uses this feedback to improve future matching accuracy. The more you use the system, the better it gets.
