Buddy's pricing system lets you offer different prices to different customer groups, with support for custom pricing overrides.

## How Pricing Works

Pricing follows a hierarchy:

1. **Customer-specific price** (highest priority): Custom price for a specific customer
2. **Tier-specific product price**: Custom price for a product within a tier
3. **Tier discount**: Percentage discount applied to base price
4. **Base price** (default): Standard product price

## Pricing Tiers

Pricing tiers let you offer automatic discounts to customer groups.

### Creating a Tier

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Pricing Tiers">
    Navigate to **Settings → Pricing Tiers**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Tier">
    Click **New Tier**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Tier">
    Enter name (e.g., "Wholesale") and default discount percentage
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to create the tier
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Tier Setup

| Tier | Default Discount | Description |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| Retail | 0% | Standard pricing (base price) |
| Wholesale | 25% | Standard wholesale customers |
| Distributor | 40% | High-volume distributors |
| VIP | 50% | Strategic accounts |

### Assigning Customers to Tiers

1. Open a customer's profile
2. Find the **Pricing Tier** field
3. Select the appropriate tier
4. Save changes

All orders for this customer automatically use tier pricing.

## Product-Level Tier Pricing

Override the tier discount for specific products:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Pricing Tiers">
    Navigate to **Settings → Pricing Tiers**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Tier">
    Click on the tier you want to configure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Product">
    Search for the product to customize
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Custom Price">
    Enter a specific price instead of using the percentage discount
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to apply
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example**: Your Wholesale tier has a 25% discount, but for Product A you want to offer it at exactly $10.00 regardless of the base price.

## Customer-Specific Pricing

For negotiated or contract pricing with individual customers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Customer Profile">
    Navigate to the customer's profile
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Pricing Tab">
    Click the **Pricing** tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Custom Price">
    Click **Add Custom Price** and select a product
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Price">
    Enter the specific price for this customer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to apply
  </Step>
</Steps>

Customer-specific prices override all tier pricing.

## Price Calculation Example

| Customer | Product Base Price | Tier | Tier Discount | Custom Price | Final Price |
|----------|-------------------|------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Acme Corp | $100 | Wholesale | 25% | — | $75 |
| Best Buy | $100 | Distributor | 40% | — | $60 |
| Special Co | $100 | Wholesale | 25% | $70 (custom) | $70 |
